All templates will be hand-coded using valid HTML and CSS. For browser support, we follow Googleâ€™s support model - "We support the current and previous major releases of Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome and Safari on a rolling basis. Each time a new version is released, we begin supporting that version and stop supporting the third most recent version.".

If specific legacy browser support is needed, please let us know and we can quote those experiences separately.
